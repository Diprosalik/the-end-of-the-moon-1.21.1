## **Features**


<br>

### **Moon gravity**

From now on, there will be Moon like gravity in the End

Most Entities will be affected by that

<br>

### **Vacuum**

The whole End will be sourounded with vacuum

You will loose some oxygen every second but less than in water

To breathe oxygen you will have to "eat" an empty bottle (Better solution comming soon)


<br>

## **End Conduit**

To make it more comfortable to live in the End without oxygen, I added a feature to be able to place the conduit in the End and will work without water

Allowed Conduit frame:
- Prismarine blocks
- Sea lantern
- Endstone bricks
- Purpure blocks
