## **Features**


<br>

### **Moon gravity**

From now on, there will be Moon like gravity in the End

Most Entities will be affected by that

<br>

### **Vacuum**

The whole End will be sourounded with vacuum

You will loose some oxygen every second but less than in water

To breathe oxygen you will have to right klick with an empty bottle on a Chorus Flower to get a Chorus Fruit Gas Bottle

For a small refill you can also snack a Chorus Fruit ;)

> Tip: Take a Conduit with you to your End fight!

<br>

### **End Conduit**

To make it more comfortable to live in the End without oxygen, I added a feature to be able to place the conduit in the End and work without water

It will attack hostiles on max power

Allowed Conduit frame:
- Prismarine blocks
- Sea lantern
- Endstone bricks
- Purpure blocks
